 <h3>welcome to my work-in-progress portfolio</h3>
<hr>

With over ten years of experience in the field of writing, I’ve polished my command of the English language and communication through various publications. While much of my background exists in the realm of books, newspaper articles, major blogs, and editing work, I spent my more recent years writing tech reviews and posts, software comparisons, in addition to (lots and <em>lots</em> of) automotive pieces.
<BR><BR>
I’ve ghostwritten hundreds of articles for clients including JD Power, The University of Southern California, and Digital Trends. I’m also a current member of the Society for Technical Communication (STC).
<BR><BR>
As my writing career transitioned into technical assignments, I realized I enjoyed writing code even more than writing comparisons of software.
<BR><BR>
So, I began my journey with the ten-month Full-Stack Development Bootcamp through MIT (focusing on the MERN stack) in January of 2021. I’m eager to find a company where I can contribute my coding education along with my communication skills in a junior developer role.
